Many Vim plug-ins need to display information in a buffer that is not user
editable and does not get saved to a file; often referred to as a scratch
buffer. The `ScratchBuffer` class, which is a specialisation of the `Buffer`
class, provides a convenient way to manage such buffers.


ScratchBuffer creation
======================

It is recommended that you use the `get_display_buffer` function rather than
create `ScratchBuffer` instances directly. This function takes care of:

- creating a new Vim buffer if necessary.
- choosing a suitable name for the buffer (one that is a very unlikely file
  name).
- actually creating the `ScratchBuffer` instance, if it does not already exist.

The `get_display_buffer` function takes a name, which identifies the scratch
buffer. The exact same `ScratchBuffer` instance is returned each time
`get_display_buffer` is called with the same name.

.. code-block:: py

    # Create a display (scratch) buffer, uniquely defined by the name 'info'.
    # The buffer's (initial) name will be '/[[info]]'.
    disp_buf = vpe.get_display_buffer('info')
    ....
    scratch_buf = vpe.get_display_buffer('info')
    scratch_buf is disp_buf   # True.


Displaying and updating
=======================

The |show| method allows the buffer to be made visible either within the current
window or after first splitting the current window. Calling *show(=* without
arguments, simply switches to the scratch buffer. Open in a split use either the
*splitlines* or *splitcols* argument. The scratch buffer is shown in the upper
or left part of the split.

The way the *splitlines* and *splitcols* arguments work are shown below. ::

         splitlines = -3                           splitlines = 3

    `--------------------'                          `--------------------'

A `ScratchBuffer` has its attributes set to prevent modification. The
|modifiable| method provides a context manager that makes it easy to update the
buffer contents. For example to add a line, just do:

.. code-block:: py

    with disp_buf.modifiable():
        disp.buf.append('A added line')


Managing the buffer
===================

Buffer name
-----------

The name given to a `ScratchBuffer` is composed of two parts, derived from the
name passed to `get_display_buffer` and an extension name. The extension name is
initially empty, but can me changed by |set_ext_name|.

.. code-block:: py

    # Create buffer to display Man pages. It will initially be called
    # /[[manpage]].
    man_buf = vpe.get_display_buffer('manpage')
    ...

    # Set the extended name, in preparation for display Vim's man page. The
    # buffer's name will not be # /[[manpage]]/vim.
    man.set_ext_name('vim')
    ...


Special identifiers
-------------------

A `ScratchBuffer` provides properties that are useful prefixes when defining
syntax, auto-commands, *etc.* specific to the buffer.

.. code-block:: py

    # Add syntax highlighting for the Man page.
    with syntax.Syntax(man.syntax_prefix) as syn:
        ...

    # Create buffer specific auto-commands.
    with vpe.AutoCmdGroup(man.auto_grp_name) as au:
        au.delete_all()
        ...


Subclassing ScratchBuffer
=========================

The `ScratchBuffer` classed may be sub-classed to meet your plug-in's needs.
Youe should use `get_display_buffer` for creation. Just pass your subclass as
the *buf_class* argument.

A couple of the `ScratchBuffer` methods are specifically intended to be extended
by subclasses - |init_options| and |on_first_showing|. The |init_options| method
is the place to set any specia buffer specific option values. The
|on_first_showing| method is invoked once, the first time the buffer becomes
visible in a window. This is useful for performing any initialisation that
depends on the buffer being current, such as defning syntax highlighting.

.. code-block:: py

    class ManPageBuffer(vpe.ScratchBuffer):
        """A buffer tuned to displaying man pages."""

        def on_first_showing(self):
            # Add syntax highlighting for the Man page.
            with syntax.Syntax(self.syntax_prefix) as syn:
                ...


    man_buf = vpe.get_display_buffer('manpage', buf_class=ManPageBuffer)
