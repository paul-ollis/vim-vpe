This is the documentation for version 0.7.1.

VPE provides a toolkit of modules and classes aimed at making it easier to
extend ``Vim`` using modern Pythonic code. Its key features are:

- A `Vim` class and corresponding `vim<vpe.vim>` singleton which provides an API
  that is is extremely compatible with Vim's built-in ``vim`` module, but
  includes extended capabilities.

  This makes it relatively easy to convert existing Python based Vim extensions
  and then start to take advantage of the `Vim` class's extra features. See
  :ref:`switching_from_vim` for how to do this.

- The `vpe` package, containing additional modules and classes which provide:

  - More pythonic APIs for some Vim features.
  - Extension modules and classes to help in writing plugins in Python.

- Support for plugins, using Python's standard library entry-point mechanism.
