The VPE directory tree is structured as a package with a single plugin.
Assuming your Vim files are in the "~/.vim" directory, add a "pack"
sub-directory and install VPE into the "~/.vim/pack" directory. One way to do
this is by simply cloning the VPE repository.
::

    $ cd ~/.vim/pack
    $ git clone https://github.com/paul-ollis/vim-vpe.git

or just unzip vim-vpe.zip.
::

    $ cd ~/.vim/pack
    $ unzip vim-vpe.zip

The package includes a "vim-vpe/start/vpe/plugin/vpe.vim" startup script that
updates the Python path so that the *vpe* package can be imported.
