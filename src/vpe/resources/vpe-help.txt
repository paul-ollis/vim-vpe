  |___/_/   /_____/
<
VPE provides a toolkit of modules and classes aimed at making it easier to
extend Vim using modern Pythonic code. Its key features are:

  - A |Vim| class and corresponding |vim| singleton that provides an API that is
    is extremely compatible with Vim’s built-in vim module, but includes extended
    capabilities.

    This makes it relatively easy to convert existing Python based Vim extensions
    in order to take advantage of the |Vim| class’s extra features.

  - The |vpe| package, containing additional modules and classes which provide:

      - More pythonic APIs for some Vim features.

      - Extension modules and classes to help in writing plugins in Python.

  - A Pythonic plugin mechanism for writing plugins, based on Python’s own
    standardised plugin mechanisms.

NOTE:

  This Vim help file provides details of the VPE API and can be useful as a
  reference. However, the user guide at:

    https://vim-vpe.readthedocs.io/en/userguide/

  is much easier to browse and provides more information.

===============================================================================~
1. Quick start~                                               *vpe.quick-start*

The quickest way to start using VPE is to import the vim object:
  >
  from vpe import vim
<
The vim object is an instance of the |Vim| class and is intended to be a drop
in replacement for Vim’s standard |python-vim| module, but with a number of
enhancements.

  - Most of Vim’s functions appear as members, for example:
      >
      vim.cursor(4, 10)            # Position cursor at row 4, column 10.
      m = vim.execute('messages')  # Get all the recent Vim messages.
<
  - The attributes buffers, current, options, tabpages, vars, vvars and windows
    provide enhanced access to the corresponding Vim objects. For example
    vim.current.buffer provides a |Buffer| instance in place of Vim’s standard
    |python-buffer|.

  - The Vim registers are available using the |registers| attribute.

  - When errors occur a |VimError| is raised, which provides a better breakdown
    of the error. This is a subclass of vim.error (|python-error|) so existing
    code that catches vim.error still works.

===============================================================================~
2. Features~                                                     *vpe.features*

This is a brief list of VPE’s features.

  - A |Vim| class that provides an enhanced, drop-in replacement for the standard
    python-vim module.

  - Classes |Window|, |Buffer|, |TabPage| are enhanced wrappers around the
    standard vim versions.

  - Support for cleanly invoking Python functions for keyboard mappings.

  - Pythonic support for using popup-windows. (Requires Vim 8.2.)

  - Pythonic support for using timers.

  - Pythonic support for autocommands that invoke Python functions.

  - Python support for channels.

  - Logging to a buffer. Useful when developing and debugging plug-ins.

===============================================================================~
3. Module vpe~                                                 *vpe.module-vpe*

Enhanced module for using Python 3 in Vim.

This provides the Vim class, which is a wrapper around Vim’s built-in vim
module. It is intended that a Vim instance can be uses as a replacement for the
vim module. For example:
  >
  from vpe import vim
  # Now use 'vim' as an extended version of the *vim* module.
  # ...
<
The VPE module uses certain global Vim variables for its own internal purposes.
The names are chosen to be suitably obscure, but obviously associated with VPE.

  _vpe_args_
    This is a dictionary that is used by a Vim function to pass information to
    Python callback functions. Predefined entries are:

      ‘uid’
        The unique ID for the callback function to be invoked.

      ‘args’
        A sequence of any unnamed arguments passed to the Vim function.

Attributes

  vpe.VIM_DEFAULT                                             *vpe.VIM_DEFAULT*

    Special value representing default Vi value for an option.

  vpe.commands                                                   *vpe.commands*
    An object providing Vim commands as methods.

    This is an instance of the |Commands| class.

  vpe.log                                                             *vpe.log*
    The Vpe log support object.

    This is an instance of the |Log| class.

  vpe.vim                                                             *vpe.vim*
    A replacement for (and wrapper around) the |python-vim| module.

    This is in instance of the |Vim| class.

class vpe.AutoCmdGroup(name)                  *AutoCmdGroup* *vpe.AutoCmdGroup*
  A Pythonic way to define auto commands.

  This is a context manager that supports definition of autocommands that:

    - Are always in a given group.

    - Invoke Python code when triggered.

  It is intended to be used as:
    >
    with AutoCmdGroup('mygroup') as g:
        g.delete_all()
        g.add('BufWritePre', handle_bufwrite, ...)
        g.add('BufDelete', handle_bufdelete, ...)

    ...

    # Add more autocommands to the same group.
    with AutoCmdGroup('mygroup') as g:
        g.delete_all()
        g.add('BufWritePre', handle_bufwrite, ...)
<
  Parameters

    name
      The name of the group.

  Static methods

    static add(...)                                      *vpe.AutoCmdGroup.add*
        >
        add(
                event,
                func,
                pat: str | wrappers.Buffer = '<buffer>',
                once: bool = False,
                nested: bool = False,
                inc_event: bool = False,
<

      Parameters

        event
          The name of the event.

        func
          The Python function to invoke. Plain functions and instance methods
          are supported.

        pat: str | vpe.wrappers.Buffer
          The file pattern to match. If not supplied then the special
          ‘<buffer>’ pattern is used. If the argument is a |Buffer| then the
          special pattern ‘<buffer=N> is used.

        once: bool
          The standard ‘:autocmd’ options.

        nested: bool
          The standard ‘:autocmd’ options.

        inc_event: bool
          Include event='event-name' in the callback invocation.

        kwargs
          Additional keyword arguments to be passed in the callback invocation.

    static delete_all()                           *vpe.AutoCmdGroup.delete_all*
      Delete all entries in the group.

class vpe.BufEventHandler                                 *vpe.BufEventHandler*
  Mix-in to support mapping events to methods for buffers.

  This ties mapped events to the buffer. This mixin is used by the
  |ManagedIOBuffer| and may also be used for for classes derived from
  |ScratchBuffer|.

  Methods

                               *vpe.BufEventHandler.auto_define_event_handlers*
    auto_define_event_handlers(group_name: str, delete_all=False)
      Set up mappings for event handling methods.

      This appends _<self.number> to the provided group_name and then invokes
      |vpe.EventHandler.auto_define_event_handlers|.

      Parameters

        group_name: str
          A string that is uses to generate a (hopefully) unique autocmd group
          name.

        delete_all
          If set then all previous auto commands in the group are deleted.

                                                *BufListener* *vpe.BufListener*
class vpe.BufListener(func, buf, ops: bool = True, raw_changes: bool = False)
  An extension of |Callback| for Vim’s buffer change callbacks.

  One of these is created by |vpe.Buffer.add_listener|. Direct instantiation of
  this class is not recommended or supported.

  Parameters

    func
      The Python function or method to be called back.

    buf
      The |Buffer| instance.

    ops
      Include the |Operation| changes as an additional argument:

    raw_changes
      Include the raw changes as an additional argument:

  Attributes

    buf                                                   *vpe.BufListener.buf*
      The |Buffer| instance.

    listen_id                                       *vpe.BufListener.listen_id*
      The unique ID from a |listener_add| invocation.

    ops                                             *ops* *vpe.BufListener.ops*
      Include the |Operation| changes as an additional argument:

    raw_changes                     *raw_changes* *vpe.BufListener.raw_changes*
      Include the raw changes as an additional argument:

  Methods

    invoke_cb(func, vpe_args)                       *vpe.BufListener.invoke_cb*
      Invoke this Callback.

      This extends the |vpe.Callback.invoke_cb| method.

      The vpe_args[‘args’] are (From Vim’s docs):

        bufnr
          The buffer that was changed

        start
          First changed line number

        end
          First line number below the change

        added
          Number of lines added, negative if lines were deleted

        changes
          A List of items with details about the changes

      The bufnr is ignored, since this is just self.buf.number.

      Start and end are adjusted so they form a Python range.

      If |ops| is True then a list of operations is provided to the callback as
      an ops keyword argument. Each entry in the changes is converted to one of
      an |AddOp|, |DeleteOp| or |ChangeOp|.

      Similarly, if |raw_changes| is True then the list of operations provided
      by Vim is provided to the callback as a raw_changes keyword argument.

    stop_listening()                           *vpe.BufListener.stop_listening*
      Stop listening for changes.

      This permanently disables this listener.

class vpe.Buffer(buffer)                                  *Buffer* *vpe.Buffer*
  Wrapper around a |python-buffer|.

  User code should not directly instantiate this class. VPE creates and manages
  instances of this class as required.

  A number of extensions to the standard |python-buffer| are provided.

    - The |vars| property provides access to the buffer’s variables.

    - The |list| context manager provides a clean, and often more efficient, way
      to access the buffer’s content.

    - The |temp_options| context manager provides a clean way to work with a
      buffer with some of its options temporarily modified.

    - Buffer specific meta-data can be attached using the |store|.

    - The values provided by |getbufinfo()| are effectively available as
      properties of this class.

  Properties

    property bufnr -> int                                    *vpe.Buffer.bufnr*
      The same as the |number| attribute.

      This exists as a side effect of providing |getbufinfo()| values as
      properties. It is more  efficient to use the |number| attribute.

    property changed -> int                                *vpe.Buffer.changed*
      Modified flag; 0=unchanged, 1=changed.

    property changedtick -> int                        *vpe.Buffer.changedtick*
      Same as |changetick|.

    property hidden -> int                                  *vpe.Buffer.hidden*
      Hidden flag; 0=buffer visible in a window, 1=buffer hidden.

    property lastused -> int                              *vpe.Buffer.lastused*
      Time (in seconds) when buffer was last used.

      This is a time in seconds as returned by |localtime()|.

    property linecount -> int                            *vpe.Buffer.linecount*
      The number of lines in the buffer.

    property lnum -> int                                      *vpe.Buffer.lnum*
      The current line number for the buffer.

    property loaded -> int                                  *vpe.Buffer.loaded*
      Buffer loaded flag; 0=not loaded, 1=buffer loaded.

    property location -> str                   *location* *vpe.Buffer.location*
      The location of the file loaded in this buffer.

      If the buffer is not associated with a file then an empty string.
      Otherwise the absolute directory part of the file’s name.

    property long_display_name -> str            *vpe.Buffer.long_display_name*
      A long-form name for display purposes.

    property number                                *number* *vpe.Buffer.number*
      The number of this buffer.

    property popups -> list[int]                            *vpe.Buffer.popups*
      A list of window IDs for popups that are displaying this buffer.

      Each entry is a |window-ID|.

    property short_description -> str            *vpe.Buffer.short_description*
      A short description for the buffer.

      For a quickfix window this is the title string. For a terminal this is
      the buffer’s name. For other types that are associated with a file the
      |location| property is provided.

    property short_display_name -> str          *vpe.Buffer.short_display_name*
      A short-form name for display purposes.

    property type -> str                                      *vpe.Buffer.type*
      The type name of this buffer.

      This is similar to the 'buftype' option, but normal buffers have the type
      ‘normal’.

    property valid -> bool                           *valid* *vpe.Buffer.valid*
      Test of this buffer is valid.

      A buffer can become invalid if, for example, the underlying Vim buffer
      has been wiped out.

    property variables -> |Variables|                    *vpe.Buffer.variables*
      The same as the |vars| attribute.

      This exists as a side effect of providing |getbufinfo()| values as
      properties. It is more  efficient to use the |vars| attribute.

    property vars -> |Variables|                       *vars* *vpe.Buffer.vars*
      The buffer vars wrapped as a |Variables| instance.

    property windows -> list[int]                          *vpe.Buffer.windows*
      A list of window IDs for windows that are displaying this buffer.

      Each entry is a |window-ID|.

  Methods

    __getattr__(name)                                  *vpe.Buffer.__getattr__*
      Make the values from getbufinfo() available as attributes.

      This extends the base class implementation.

    add_listener(...)                                 *vpe.Buffer.add_listener*
        >
        add_listener(
                func: ListenerCallbackFunc | ListenerCallbackMethod,
                ops: bool = True,
                raw_changes: bool = False
<
      Add a callback for changes to this buffer.

      This is implemented using |listener_add()|

      Parameters

        func: Union
          The callback function which is invoked with the following arguments:

          The buffer that was changed.

          Start of the range of modified lines (zero based).

          End of the range of modified lines.

          Number of lines added, negative if lines were deleted.

        ops: bool
          True by default. Include a list of the individual operations to the
          callback as the ops keyword argument. A list of diffs.Operation
          instances with details about the changes.

        raw_changes: bool
          False by default. Include the unmodified changes as the raw_changes
          keyword argument (see |listener_add| for details).

      Return value

      A |BufListener| object.

    append(line_or_lines, nr=None)                          *vpe.Buffer.append*
      Append one or more lines to the buffer.

      This is the same as using the append method of |python-buffer|.

      Parameters

        line_or_lines
          The line or lines to append.

        nr
          If present then append after this line number.

    clear_props()                                      *vpe.Buffer.clear_props*
      Remove all properties from all line in this buffer.

                         *find_active_windows* *vpe.Buffer.find_active_windows*
    find_active_windows(all_tabpages=False) -> list['Window']
      Find windows where this buffer is active.

      The list windows returned is prioritised as a result of searching in the
      following order. The current window, windows in the current tab page, all
      windows in all tab pages.

      Parameters

        all_tabpages
          If True then all tab pages are searched. Otherwise only the current
          tab page is searched.

      Return value

      A list of the windows found.

                                           *vpe.Buffer.find_best_active_window*
    find_best_active_window(all_tabpages=False) -> |Window| | None
      Find the best choice for a window where this buffer is active.

      This returns the first entry found by |find_active_windows|.

      Parameters

        all_tabpages
          If True (the default) all tab pages are searched. Otherwise only the
          current tab page is searched.

      Return value

      The window or None.

                                                *vpe.Buffer.goto_active_window*
    goto_active_window(all_tabpages=False) -> |Window| | None
      Goto the best choice window where this buffer is active.

      This goes to the first entry found by |find_active_windows|.

      Parameters

        all_tabpages
          If True (the default) all tab pages are searched. Otherwise only the
          current tab page is searched.

      Return value

      The window that was chosen or None.

    is_active()                                          *vpe.Buffer.is_active*
      Test whether the current window is showing this buffer.

    list()                                             *list* *vpe.Buffer.list*
      A sequence context for efficient buffer modification.

      As an example:
        >
        with vim.current.buffer.list() as lines:
            # Now lines is a copy of the buffers lines.
            lines[2:4] = ['one']  # Update lines in-place.

        # The vim.current.buffer has now been updated with modified lines.
<
      Although this involves taking a copy of the buffer’s lines and then
      completely replacing the buffer’s set of lines, this is a much more
      efficient way to make non-trivial modifications to a buffer’s contents.

      This will update the buffer, even if ‘modifiable’ is not set.

    range(a: int, b: int) -> |Range|                         *vpe.Buffer.range*
      Get a |Range| for the buffer.

      This is like getting a |python-range| object, except that it is wrapped
      in a |Range| instance.

      Parameters

        a: int
          The start line number of the range.

        b: int
          The end line number of the range. Note that this line is included in
          the range; i.e. the range is inclusive, unlike Python ranges.

    retrieve_store(key: Any) -> |Struct| | None     *vpe.Buffer.retrieve_store*
      Retrieve a given buffer store if it exists.

      This is similar to |store|, but no new store is created.

      Return value

      The requested store |Struct| or None if it does not exist.

    set_line_prop(...)               *set_line_prop* *vpe.Buffer.set_line_prop*
        >
        set_line_prop(
                lidx: int,
                start_cidx: int,
                end_cidx: int,
                hl_group: str,
<
      Set a highlighting property on a single line.

      The name of the text property is formed from the ‘name’ if provided and
      the ‘hl_group’ otherwise, by prefixing ‘vpe:hl:’. For example if
      hl_group='Label' and ‘name’ is not provided then the property is called
      ‘vpe:hl:Label’.

      The buffer specific text property is created if it does not already
      exist. Apart from the bufnr option, default values are used for the
      property’s options.

      Parameters

        lidx: int
          The index of the line to hold the property.

        start_cidx: int
          The index within the line where the property starts.

        end_cidx: int
          The index within the line where the property ends.

        hl_group: str
          The name of the highlight group to use.

        name: str
          An optional name for the property.

                         *set_rich_like_lines* *vpe.Buffer.set_rich_like_lines*
    set_rich_like_lines(lines: list[str]) -> None
      Set highlighted buffer contents from Rich-like markup text.

      This method is useful for non-edit buffers, such as obtained using
      |get_display_buffer|.

        - The entire contents of the buffer is updated.

        - Each line is parsed for mark up that looks like ‘[Macro]’ and ‘[]’.
          Names within ‘[’ and ‘]’ define highlight groups that are used to set
          text properties using |set_line_prop|. An empty ‘[]’ reverts to
          unmarked text. Use ‘[’ to insert a literal ‘[‘.

      The markup style is modelled on (https://github.com/Textualize/rich)
      (Rich). It is not compatible, but might possibly be extended to support
      some subset of Rich markup in the future.

    store(key: Any) -> |Struct|                      *store* *vpe.Buffer.store*
      Provide a |Struct| for a given key.

      This provides a mechanism to store arbitrary data associated with a given
      buffer. A new |Struct| is created the first time a given key is used. An
      example of how this can be used:
        >
        vim.current.buffer.store['my-store'].processed = True
        ...
        for buf in vim.buffers:
            if buf.store['my-store'].processed:
                # Treat already processed buffers differently.
                ...
<
      The |vpe| package arranges to return the same |Buffer| instance for a
      given |python-buffer| so this effectively allows you to associated meta-
      data with individual Vim buffers.

                                       *temp_options* *vpe.Buffer.temp_options*
    temp_options(**presets) -> TemporaryOptions
      Context used to temporarily change options.

      This makes it easy, for example, to use a normally unmodifiable buffer to
      display information in a buffer. To update the displayed buffer’s
      contents do something like:
        >
        with disp_buf.temp_options(modifiable=True):
            disp.buf.append('Another line')
<
      When the context ends, the modifiable option is reset to its original
      value. An alternative approach is:
        >
        with disp_buf.temp_options as opt:
            opt.modifiable = True
            disp.buf.append('Another line')
<
      Only options set using presets or the context object are restored when
      the context exits.

      Parameters

        presets
          One or more options values may be defined using keyword arguments.
          The values are applied when the context is entered.

  Class methods

                                                         *vpe.Buffer.get_known*
    classmethod get_known(buffer: Any) -> |Buffer| | None
      Get the Buffer instance for a given vim.buffer.

      This is only intended for internal use.

      Parameters

        buffer: Any
          A standard |python-buffer|.

  Static methods

    static escape_rich_like(text: str) -> str     *vpe.Buffer.escape_rich_like*
      Escape rich-like markup in a string.

      Use this for text that should not be interpreted when passed to the
      |set_rich_like_lines| method. This replaces all ‘[’ characters with ‘[‘.

    static markup_text(...)                            *vpe.Buffer.markup_text*
        >
        markup_text(
                text: str,
                pat: str,
                markup: str,
                rep_all: bool = True
<
      Find pat in text and apply richlike markup.

      For exmaple if text is ‘Press Q to quit’, pat is ‘Q` and markup is
      ‘Keyword’ then this returns ‘Press [Keyword]Q[] to quit’.

      This is function is provide as a convenience for simple cases of rich-
      like markup.

      Return value

      The marked up string.

class vpe.Buffers(obj=None)                             *Buffers* *vpe.Buffers*
  Wrapper around the built-in vim.buffers.

  User code should not directly instantiate this class. VPE creates and manages
  instances of this class as required.

class vpe.Callback(...)                               *Callback* *vpe.Callback*
    >
    Callback(
            func: Callable[[...], None],
            py_args: tuple[Any, ...] = (),
            py_kwargs: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
            vim_exprs: tuple[Any, ...] = (),
            pass_bytes: bool = False,
            once: bool = False,
            cleanup: Callable[[], None] | None = None,
            meta: Any | None = None,
<
  Wrapper for a function to be called from Vim.

  This encapsulates the mechanism used to arrange for a Python function to be
  invoked in response to an event in the ‘Vim World’. A Callback stores the
  Python function together with an ID that is uniquely associated with the
  function (the UID). If, for example this wraps function ‘spam’ giving it
  UID=42 then the Vim script code:
    >
    :call VPE_Call(42, 'hello', 123)
<
  will result in the Python function ‘spam’ being invoked as:
    >
    spam('hello', 123)
<
  The way this works is that the VPE_Call function first stores the UID and
  arguments in the global Vim variable _vpe_args_ in a dictionary as:
    >
    {
        'uid': 42,
        'args': ['hello', 123]
    }
<
  Then it calls this class’s |invoke| classmethod:
    >
    return py3eval('vpe.Callback.invoke()')
<
  The |invoke| class method extracts the UID and uses it to find the Callback
  instance.

  Note that a strong reference to each |Callback| instance is automatically
  stored, but only while a strong reference to the function exists.

    @callbacks    A class level mapping from |uid| to |Callback| instance. This
      is used to lookup the correct function during the execution of VPE_Call.

  Parameters

    func

      Expressions used as positional arguments for the VPE_Call helper
      function.

  Methods

    as_call()                                            *vpe.Callback.as_call*
      Format a command of the form ‘call VPE_Call(“42”, …)’.

      The result can be used as a colon prompt command.

    as_invocation()                                *vpe.Callback.as_invocation*
      Format an expression of the form ‘VPE_Call(“42”, …)’.

      The result is a valid Vim script expression.

    as_vim_function()                            *vpe.Callback.as_vim_function*
      Create a vim.Function that will route to this callback.

    format_call_fail_message()          *vpe.Callback.format_call_fail_message*
      Generate a message to give details of a failed callback invocation.

      This is used when the |Callback| instance exists, but the call raised an
      exception.

    get_call_args(_vpe_args: Dict[str, Any])       *vpe.Callback.get_call_args*
      Get the Python positional and keyword arguments.

      This may be over-ridden by subclasses.

    invoke_cb(func: Callable, vpe_args: dict)          *vpe.Callback.invoke_cb*
      Invoke this Callback.

      This invokes the function as:
        >
        func(*args, *vim_args, **kwargs)
<
      Where args and kwargs are those provided when this instance was created.
      The vim_args arr the ‘args’ from the vpe_args dictionary.

      Parameters

        vpe_args: dict
          A dictionary containing:

            uid
              The unique ID that is used to find the correct |Callback|
              instance.

            args
              Any additional arguments passed to the callback by Vim.

  Class methods

    classmethod invoke() -> Any                  *invoke* *vpe.Callback.invoke*
      Invoke a particular callback function instance.

      This is invoked from the ‘Vim World’ by VPE_Call. The global Vim
      dictionary variable _vpe_args_ will have been set up to contain ‘uid’ and
      ‘args’ entries. The ‘uid’ is used to find the actual |Callback| instance
      and the ‘args’ is a sequence of Vim values, which are passed to the
      callback as positional arguments.

      The details are store in the Vim global variable _vpe_args_, which is a
      dictionary containing:

        uid
          The unique ID that is used to find the correct |Callback| instance.

        args
          Any additional arguments passed to the callback by Vim.

      It is possible that there is no instance for the given |uid|. In that
      case a message is logged, but no other action taken.

      Return value

      Normally the return value of the invoked function. If the callback is
      dead then the value is zero and if an exception is raised then the value
      is -1.

class vpe.CommandHandler                                   *vpe.CommandHandler*
  Mix-in to support mapping user commands to methods.

  To use this do the following:

    - Make your class inherit from this class.

    - Decorate methods that implement commands using the |command| class method.
      A decorated method expect to be invoked with multiple positional
      parameters, one per command line argument.

    - In your init function, invoke self.auto_define_commands().

  Your code should only create a single instance of the class.

  Methods

    auto_define_commands()            *vpe.CommandHandler.auto_define_commands*
      Set up mappings for command methods.

  Static methods

                                         *command* *vpe.CommandHandler.command*
    static command(name: str, **kwargs) -> Callable[[Callable], Callable]
      Decorator to make a user command invoke a method.

      Parameters

        name: str
          The name of the user defined command.

        kwargs
          See |vpe.define_command| for the supported values.

    >
    CommandInfo(
            line1: int,
            line2: int,
            range: int,
            count: int,
            bang: bool,
            mods: str,
<
  Information passed to a user command callback handler.

  Attributes

      True if the command was invoked with a ‘!’.

    count                                               *vpe.CommandInfo.count*
      Any count value supplied (see |command-count|).

      The command modifiers (see `:command-modifiers`).

    range                                               *vpe.CommandInfo.range*
      The number of items in the command range: 0, 1 or 2 Requires at least vim
      8.0.1089; for earlier versions this is fixed as -1.

    reg                                                   *vpe.CommandInfo.reg*
      The optional register, if provided.

class vpe.Current(obj=None)                             *Current* *vpe.Current*
  Wrapper around the built-in vim.current attribute.

class vpe.EventHandler                                       *vpe.EventHandler*
  Mix-in to support mapping events to methods.

  This provides a convenient alternative to direct use of |AutoCmdGroup|. The
  default pattern (see |autocmd-patterns|) is ‘*’ unless explicitly set by the
  |handle| decorator.

  Methods

                                  *vpe.EventHandler.auto_define_event_handlers*
    auto_define_event_handlers(group_name: str, delete_all=False)
      Set up mappings for event handling methods.

      Parameters

        group_name: str
          The name for the auto command group (see |augrp|). This will be
          converted to a valid Vim identifier.

        delete_all
          If set then all previous auto commands in the group are deleted.

  Static methods

                                             *handle* *vpe.EventHandler.handle*
    static handle(name: str, **kwargs) -> Callable[[Callable], Callable]
      Decorator to make an event invoke a method.

      Parameters

        name: str
          The name of the event (see |autocmd-events|.

        kwargs
          See |vpe.AutoCmdGroup.add| for the supported arguments. Note that the
          pat argument defaults to ‘*’, not ‘<buffer>’.

class vpe.Finish(reason: str)                                      *vpe.Finish*
  Used by plugin’s to abort installation.

  This is intended to play a similar role to the `:finish` command, as used in
  plug-ins that may not be able to complete initialisation.

  Parameters

    reason
      A string providing the reason for aborting.

class vpe.GlobalOptions(vim_options)        *GlobalOptions* *vpe.GlobalOptions*
  Wrapper for vim.options, etc.

  This extends the behaviour so that options appear as attributes. The standard
  dictionary style access still works.

                                                                *Log* *vpe.Log*
class vpe.Log(name: str, maxlen: int = 500, timestamps: bool = True)
  Support for logging to a display buffer.

  An instance of this class provides a mechanism to support logging that can be
  viewed within a buffer. Instances of this class act as a simple print
  function.:
    >
    info = Log('my_info')
    info("Created log", info)
    info("Starting process")
<
  The output is stored in a Python FIFO structure, up to a maximum number of
  lines; the default is 500, change this with |set_maxlen|. No actual Vim
  buffer is created until required, which is when |show| is first invoked.:
    >
    info.show()   # Make the log visible.
<
  The |vpe| module provides a predefined log, called ‘VPE’. This is available
  for general use. VPE also uses it to log significant occurrences - mainly
  error conditions.

  Parameters

    name
      A name that maps to the corresponding display buffer.

    maxlen
      The maximum number of lines to store.

    timestamps
      Set this to False to prevent the addition of timestamps.

  Attributes

    buf                                                           *vpe.Log.buf*
      The corresponding Vim buffer. This will be None if the |show| method has
      never been invoked.

    name                                                         *vpe.Log.name*
      A name that maps to the corresponding display buffer.

  Properties

    property lines -> list[str]                                 *vpe.Log.lines*
      The lines currently in the log.

      This is used by the VPE test suite. It is not really intended to general
      use and unlikely to be generally useful. Note that each access to this
      property creates a new list.

    property maxlen -> int                                     *vpe.Log.maxlen*
      The current maximum length.

  Methods

    __call__(*args)                                          *vpe.Log.__call__*
      Write to the log.

      The arguments are formatted using print and then appended to the log
      buffer, with a time stamp.

      Parameters

        args
          The same as for Python’s print function.

    clear() -> None                                             *vpe.Log.clear*
      Clear all lines from the log.

      The FIFO is cleared and the corresponding buffer updated.

    flush()                                                     *vpe.Log.flush*
      File like I/O support.

    hide() -> None                                               *vpe.Log.hide*
      Hide the log buffer, if showing.

    redirect()                                               *vpe.Log.redirect*
      Redirect stdout/stderr to the log.

    set_maxlen(maxlen: int) -> None           *set_maxlen* *vpe.Log.set_maxlen*
      Set the maximum length of the log’s FIFO.

      This will discard older lines if necessary.

      Parameters

        maxlen: int
          How many lines to store in the FIFO.

    show() -> None                                        *show* *vpe.Log.show*
      Make sure the buffer is visible.

      If there is no buffer currently displayed the log then this will:

        - Split the current window.

        - Create a buffer and show it in the new split.

    unredirect()                                           *vpe.Log.unredirect*
      Disable stdout/stderr redirection.

    write(s)                                                    *vpe.Log.write*
      Write a string to the log buffer.

      Parameters

        s
          The string to write.

                                        *ManagedIOBuffer* *vpe.ManagedIOBuffer*
class vpe.ManagedIOBuffer(name, buffer, simple_name=None)
  A buffer that does not map directly to a file.

  DO NOT DIRECTLY INSTANTIATE THIS CLASS.

  Use |get_managed_io_buffer|, which creates a buffer with suitably formatted
  names and, critically, ensures that it is added into the vim.buffers objects.

  This is useful when you neeed to control how the contents of an editable
  buffer a read and written. An example of this might be if you were writing a
  clone of the :vim:’pi_netrw’ plugin, where the buffer’s name does not
  corresond to a name of a file on your computer’s storage.

  To use this class you will typically need to subclass it and then override
  the |load_contents| and |save_contents| methods. To create an instance of
  your subclass you should use |get_managed_io_buffer|, passing your subclass
  as the buf_class argument.

  The underlying Vim buffer is configured with the following key option values:
    >
    buftype = acwrite
    swapfile = False
    bufhidden = hide
    buflisted = True
<
  Methods

                            *load_contents* *vpe.ManagedIOBuffer.load_contents*
    load_contents() -> None
      Load the buffer’s contents.

      This will typically be overridden in your subclass. It can provide the
      contents of the buffer by whatever means required. The buffer’s modified
      option is cleared once this returns.

    on_first_showing()                   *vpe.ManagedIOBuffer.on_first_showing*
      Invoked when the buffer is first, successfully displayed.

      Subclasses can implement this as required.

                            *save_contents* *vpe.ManagedIOBuffer.save_contents*
    save_contents() -> bool
      Save the buffer’s contents.

      This will typically be overridden in your subclass. It can store the
      contents of the buffer by whatever means required.

      Note: the buffer’s contents must not be modified by this method.

      Return value

      True to indicate that the contents have been successully stored, in which
      case the buffer’s modified option is reset.

                                              *OneShotTimer* *vpe.OneShotTimer*
class vpe.OneShotTimer(ms: int, func: Callable[[...], None])
  A version of |Timer| that can be used ‘set-and-forget’.

  This version makes sure that a reference to the function and the
  |OneShotTimer| instance is saved until the timer fires. This means that this
  type of code will work:
    >
    def one_shot_example():
        def fire():
            print('Bang!')
        OneShotTimer(1000, fire)
<
  The callback function is invoked without arguments.

  Methods

    invoke_cb(func: Callable, vpe_args: dict)      *vpe.OneShotTimer.invoke_cb*
      Invoke the callback as a result of the timer firing.

class vpe.Options(vim_options)                                    *vpe.Options*
  Wrapper for buffer.options, etc.

  This extends the behaviour so that options appear as attributes. The standard
  dictionary style access still works.

class vpe.Popup(...)                                        *Popup* *vpe.Popup*
    >
    Popup(
            content: str | list[str] | list[dict],
            name: str = '',
            rich: bool = False,
<
  A Pythonic way to use Vim’s popup windows.

  This can be used as instead of the individual functions popup_create,
  popup_hide, popup_show, popup_settext, popup_close).

  Creation of a Popup uses vim.popup_create to create the actual popup window.
  Control of the popup windows is achieved using the methods |hide|, |show| and
  |settext|. You can subclass this in order to override the |on_close| or
  |on_key| methods.

  The subclasses |PopupAtCursor|, |PopupBeval|, |PopupNotification|,
  |PopupDialog| and |PopupMenu|, provide similar convenient alternatives to
  popup_atcursor, popup_beval, popup_notification, popup_dialog and popup_menu.

  The windows options (line, col, pos, etc.) are made avaiable as properties of
  the same name. For example, to change the first displayed line:
    >
    p = vpe.Popup(my_text)
    ...
    p.firstline += 3
<
  The close option must be accessed as close_control, because |close| is a
  Popup method. There is no filter or callback property.

  Parameters

    content
      The content for the window.

    name
      An optional name for the Popup. If provided then a named |ScratchBuffer|
      is used for the content rather than letting Vim create one.

    p_options
      Vim popup_create() options can be provided as keyword arguments. The
      exceptions are filter and callback. Over ride the |on_key| and |on_close|
      methods instead.

  Properties

    property buffer -> wrappers.Buffer | None                *vpe.Popup.buffer*
      The buffer holding the window’s content.

      A |Buffer| or None.

    property id -> int                                           *vpe.Popup.id*
      The ID of the Vim popup window.

  Methods

    close(result: int = 0) -> None                    *close* *vpe.Popup.close*
      Close the popup.

      Parameters

        result: int
          The result value that will be forwarded to on_close.

    hide() -> None                                      *hide* *vpe.Popup.hide*
      Hide the popup.

    move(**p_options) -> None                                  *vpe.Popup.move*
      Set a number of move options at once.

      An efficient way to set multiple options that affect the popup’s
      position.

    on_close(result: int) -> None               *on_close* *vpe.Popup.on_close*
      Invoked when the popup is closed.

      The default implementation does nothing, it is intended that this be
      over-ridden in subclasses.

      Parameters

        result: int
          The value passed to |close|. This will be -1 if the user forcefully
          closed the popup.

                                                    *on_key* *vpe.Popup.on_key*
    on_key(key: str | bytes, byte_seq: bytes) -> bool
      Invoked when the popup receives a keypress.

      The default implementation does nothing, it is intended that this be
      over-ridden in subclasses. The keystream is preprocessed before this
      method is invoked as follows:

        - Merged key sequences are split, so that this is always invoked with the
          sequence for just a single key.

        - Anything that does not convert to a special name is decoded to a Python
          string, if possible.

        - Special key sequences are converted to the standard Vim symbolic names
          such as <Up>, <LeftMouse>, <F11>, etc. Modifiers are also handled where
          possible - the modified symbolic names known to be available are:

            - <S-Up> <S-Down> <S-Left> <S-Right> <S-Home> <S-End> <S-Insert>

            - <C-F1> <C-F2>, etc.

            - <C-A> <M-A> <S-M-A> <C-M-A>, <C-B> … <C-M-Z>

      Parameters

        key: str | bytes
          The pressed key. This is typically a single character string such as
          ‘a’ or a symbolic Vim keyname, such as ‘<F1>’. However, it can also
          be a 3 byte sequence starting b’ý’, which occurs when Vim converts
          internal events into special key sequences.

        byte_seq: bytes
          The unmodified byte sequence, as would be received for a filter
          callback using Vimscript.

      Return value

      True if the key should be considered consumed.

    setoptions(**p_options) -> None                      *vpe.Popup.setoptions*
      Set a number of options at once.

      This is useful to set certain groups of options that cannot be separately
      set. For example ‘textpropid’ cannot be set unless ‘textprop’ is set in
      the same popup_setoptions call.

    settext(content) -> None                      *settext* *vpe.Popup.settext*
      Set the text of the popup.

    show() -> None                                             *vpe.Popup.show*
      Show the popup.

  Class methods

    classmethod clear(force: bool) -> None                    *vpe.Popup.clear*
      Clear all popups from display.

      Use this in preference to vim.popup_clear, to ensure that VPE cleans up
      its underlying administrative structures.

      Parameters

        force: bool
          If true then if the current window is a popup, it will also be
          closed.

class vpe.PopupAtCursor(...)                *PopupAtCursor* *vpe.PopupAtCursor*
    >
    PopupAtCursor(
            content: str | list[str] | list[dict],
            name: str = '',
            rich: bool = False,
<
  Popup configured to appear near the cursor.

  This creates the popup using popup_atcursor().

class vpe.PopupBeval(...)                         *PopupBeval* *vpe.PopupBeval*
    >
    PopupBeval(
            content: str | list[str] | list[dict],
            name: str = '',
            rich: bool = False,
<
  Popup configured to appear near (v:beval_line, v:beval_col).

  This creates the popup using popup_beval().

class vpe.PopupDialog(...)                      *PopupDialog* *vpe.PopupDialog*
    >
    PopupDialog(
            content: str | list[str] | list[dict],
            name: str = '',
            rich: bool = False,
<
  Popup configured as a dialogue.

  This creates the popup using popup_dialog(). It also provides a default
  |vpe.PopupDialog.on_key| implementation that invokes popup_filter_yesno.

  Methods

    on_key(key, byte_seq)                              *vpe.PopupDialog.on_key*
      Invoke popup_filter_yesno to handle keys for this popup.

class vpe.PopupMenu(...)                            *PopupMenu* *vpe.PopupMenu*
    >
    PopupMenu(
            content: str | list[str] | list[dict],
            name: str = '',
            rich: bool = False,
<
  Popup configured as a menu.

  This creates the popup using popup_menu(). It also provides a default
  |vpe.PopupMenu.on_key| implementation that invokes popup_filter_menu.

  Methods

    on_key(key, byte_seq)                                *vpe.PopupMenu.on_key*
      Invoke popup_filter_menu to handle keys for this popup.

                                    *PopupNotification* *vpe.PopupNotification*
class vpe.PopupNotification(content, name: str = '', **p_options)
  Popup configured as a short lived notification (default 3s).

  This creates the popup in a similar manner to popup_notification.

  Note that popup_notification cannot be used because because callback
  invocation fails rather wierdly if the popup closes due to a timeout. The
  main |Popup| class provides its own timeout mechanism., which does not suffer
  from this problem.

class vpe.Range(obj=None)                                   *Range* *vpe.Range*
  Wrapper around the built-in vim.Range type.

  User code should not directly instantiate this class.

  Methods

    append(line_or_lines, nr=None)                           *vpe.Range.append*
      Append one or more lines to the range.

      This is the same as using the append method of |python-range|.

      Parameters

        line_or_lines
          The line or lines to append.

        nr
          If present then append after this line number.

class vpe.Registers                                 *Registers* *vpe.Registers*
  Dictionary like access to the Vim registers.

  This allows Vim’s registers to be read and modified. This is typically via
  the |registers| attribute.:
    >
    vim.registers['a'] = 'A line of text'
    prev_copy = vim.registers[1]
<
  This uses |eval’ to read registers and :vim:`setreg| to write them. Keys are
  converted to strings before performing the register lookup. When the key is
  the special ‘=’ value, the un-evaluated contents of the register is returned.

  Methods

    __getitem__(reg_name: str | int) -> Any         *vpe.Registers.__getitem__*
      Allow reading registers as dictionary entries.

      The reg_name may also be an integer value in the range 0-9.

                                                    *vpe.Registers.__setitem__*
    __setitem__(reg_name: str | int, value: Any)
      Allow setting registers as dictionary entries.

      The reg_name may also be an integer value in the range 0-9.

                                            *ScratchBuffer* *vpe.ScratchBuffer*
class vpe.ScratchBuffer(name, buffer, simple_name=None)
  A scratch buffer.

  DO NOT DIRECTLY INSTANTIATE THIS CLASS.

  Use |get_display_buffer|, which creates a buffer with suitably formatted
  names and, critically, ensures that it is added into the vim.buffers objects.

  A scratch buffer has no associated file, has no swap file, never gets written
  and never appears to be modified. The content of such a buffer is typically
  under the control of plugin code. Direct editing is disabled.

  Parameters

    name
      The name for the buffer.

    buffer
      The |python-buffer| that this wraps.

    simple_name
      An alternative simple name. This is used in the generation of the
      |syntax_prefix| and |auto_grp_name| property values. If this is not set
      then is is the same a the name parameter. If this is not a valid
      identifier then it is converted to one by replacing invalid characters
      with ‘x’.

  Attributes

    simple_name                                 *vpe.ScratchBuffer.simple_name*
      An alternative simple name. This is used in the generation of the
      |syntax_prefix| and |auto_grp_name| property values. If this is not set
      then is is the same a the name parameter. If this is not a valid
      identifier then it is converted to one by replacing invalid characters
      with ‘x’.

  Properties

                              *auto_grp_name* *vpe.ScratchBuffer.auto_grp_name*
    property auto_grp_name
      A suitable name for auto commands for this buffer.

                              *syntax_prefix* *vpe.ScratchBuffer.syntax_prefix*
    property syntax_prefix
      A suitable prefix for syntax items in this buffer.

  Methods

    init_options()                             *vpe.ScratchBuffer.init_options*
      Initialise the scratch buffer specific options.

      This gets invoked via call_soon because option setting can otherwise
      silently fail for subclasses.

      Subclasses may over-ride this.

                                                 *vpe.ScratchBuffer.modifiable*
    modifiable() -> wrappers.TemporaryOptions
      Create a context that allows the buffer to be modified.

    on_first_showing()                     *vpe.ScratchBuffer.on_first_showing*
      Invoked when the buffer is first, successfully displayed.

      Subclasses can implement this as required.

    set_ext_name(name)                         *vpe.ScratchBuffer.set_ext_name*
      Set the extension name for this buffer.

      Parameters

        name
          The extension part of the name

                                                       *vpe.ScratchBuffer.show*
    show(splitlines: int = 0, splitcols: int = 0) -> bool
      Make this buffer visible.

      Without a splitlines or splitcols argument, this will use the current
      window to show this buffer. Otherwise the current window is split,
      horizontally if splitlines != 0 or vertically if splitcols != 0. The
      buffer is shown in the top/left part of the split. A positive split
      specifies how many lines/columns to allocate to the bottom/right part of
      the split. A negative split specifies how many lines to allocate to the
      top/left window.

      Parameters

        splitlines: int
          Number of lines allocated to the top/bottom of the split.

        splitcols: int
          Number of columns allocated to the left or right window of the split.

      Return value

      True if the window is successfully shown.

class vpe.Struct                                          *Struct* *vpe.Struct*
  A basic data storage structure.

  This is intended to store arbitrary name, value pairs as attributes.
  Attempting to read an undefined attribute gives None.

  This is provided primarily to support the |store| mechanism. Direct use of
  this class is not intended as part of the API.

  Methods

    __getstate__()                                    *vpe.Struct.__getstate__*
      Support pickling - only intended for testing.

    __setstate__(state)                               *vpe.Struct.__setstate__*
      Support pickling - only intended for testing.

class vpe.TabPage(tab_page: _vim.TabPage)               *TabPage* *vpe.TabPage*
  Wrapper around a |python-tabpage|.

  User code should not directly instantiate this class. VPE creates and manages
  instances of this class as required.

  This is a proxy that extends the vim.TabPage behaviour in various ways.

  Properties

    property buffers -> list[|Buffer|]                    *vpe.TabPage.buffers*
      A list of the buffers visible in the tab page.

      The list is in the same order as the tab page’s windows, but does not
      contain duplicates.

    property vars                                            *vpe.TabPage.vars*
      The buffer vars wrapped as a |Variables| instance.

  Methods

                                                   *vpe.TabPage.retrieve_store*
    retrieve_store(key: Any) -> |Struct| | None
      Retrieve a given tabpage store if it exists.

      This is similar to |store|, but no new store is created.

      Return value

      The requested store |Struct| or None if it does not exist or this tab
      page has been closed (|valid| is False).

    store(key: Any) -> |Struct| | None                      *vpe.TabPage.store*
      Provide a |Struct| for a given key.

      This provides a mechanism to store arbitrary data associated with a given
      tab page. A new |Struct| is created the first time a given key is used.
      An example of how this can be used:
        >
        vim.current.tabpage.store['my-store'].processed = True
        ...
        for page in vim.buffers:
            if page.store['my-store'].processed:
                # Treat already processed tab pages differently.
                ...
<
      The |vpe| package arranges to return the same |TabPage| instance for a
      given |python-tabpage| so this effectively allows you to associated meta-
      data with individual Vim tab pages.

      If the underlying tab page has been closed (|valid| is False) then this
      simply returns None.

  Class methods

                                                        *vpe.TabPage.get_known*
    classmethod get_known(tab_page: _vim.TabPage | |TabPage|) -> |TabPage| | None
      Get the TabPage instance for a given vim.tab_page.

      This is only intended for internal use.

      Parameters

        tab_page: vim.TabPage | vpe.wrappers.TabPage
          A standard |python-tab_page| or a TabPage.

class vpe.TabPages                                    *TabPages* *vpe.TabPages*
  Wrapper around the built-in vim.tabpages.

  User code should not directly instantiate this class. VPE creates and manages
  instances of this class as required.

  This is a proxy that extends the vim.TabPages behaviour in various ways.

  Static methods

    static new(position='after')                             *vpe.TabPages.new*
      Create a new tab page.

      Parameters

        position
          The position relative to this tab. The standard character prefixes
          for the `:tabnew` command can be used or one of the more readable
          strings:

            ‘after’, ‘before’
              Immediately after or before the current tab (same as ‘.’, ‘-‘),

            ‘first’, ‘last’
              As the first or last tab (same as ‘0’, ‘$’),

          This defaults to ‘after’.

class vpe.Timer(...)                                        *Timer* *vpe.Timer*
    >
    Timer(
            ms: int | float,
            func: Callable[[...], None],
            repeat: int | None = None,
            pass_timer: bool = True,
            meta: Any | None = None,
            args=(),
<
  Pythonic way to use Vim’s timers.

  This can be used as a replacement for the vim functions: timer_start,
  timer_info, timer_pause, timer_stop.

  An example of usage:
    >
    def handle_expire(t):
        print(f'Remaining repeats = {t.repeat}')

    # This will cause handle_expire to be called twice. The output will be:
    #     t.repeat=2
    #     t.repeat=1
    t = Timer(ms=100, handle_expire, repeat=2)
<
  The status of a timer can be queried using the properties |time|, |repeat|,
  |remaining| and |paused|. The methods |pause|, |stop| and |resume| allow an
  active timer to be controlled.

  A timer with ms == 0 is a special case. It is used to schedule an action to
  occur as soon as possible once Vim is waiting for user input. Consequently
  the repeat argument is forced to be 1 and the pass_timer argument is forced
  to be False.

  Parameters

    ms
      The timer’s interval in milliseconds. The value int(ms) is used.

    func
      The function to be invoked when the timer fires. This is called with the
      firing |Timer| instance as the only parameter.

    repeat
      How many times to fire. This defaults to a single firing.

    pass_timer
      Set this false to prevent the timer being passed to func.

    meta
      Arbitrary meta-data to be stored in the Callback’s |meta| attribute.

    args
      Optional positional arguments to pass to func.

    kwargs
      Optional keyword arguments to pass to func.

  Attributes

    args                                                       *vpe.Timer.args*
      Optional positional arguments to pass to func.

    dead                                                       *vpe.Timer.dead*
      This is set true when the timer is no longer active because all repeats
      have occurred or because the callback function is no longer available.

    fire_count                                           *vpe.Timer.fire_count*
      This increases by one each time the timer’s callback is invoked.

    kwargs                                                   *vpe.Timer.kwargs*
      Optional keyword arguments to pass to func.

    meta                                                       *vpe.Timer.meta*
      Arbitrary meta-data to be stored in the Callback’s |meta| attribute.

  Properties

    property id -> int                                           *vpe.Timer.id*
      The ID of the underlying vim timer.

    property paused -> bool                         *paused* *vpe.Timer.paused*
      True if the timer is currently paused.

    property remaining -> int                 *remaining* *vpe.Timer.remaining*
      The time remaining (ms) until the timer will next fire.

    property repeat -> int                          *repeat* *vpe.Timer.repeat*
      The number of times the timer will still fire.

      Note that prior to Vim patch 8.2.3768 this was 1 greater that one might
      expect. Now Vim’s timer_info() returns the expected value except during
      the final callback, when we get None. This is non-Pythonic, so None is
      converted to zero.

    property time -> int                                *time* *vpe.Timer.time*
      The time value used to create the timer.

  Methods

    finish()                                                 *vpe.Timer.finish*
      Take action when a timer is finished.

    invoke_cb(func: Callable, vpe_args: dict)             *vpe.Timer.invoke_cb*
      Invoke the callback as a result of the timer firing.

    pause()                                           *pause* *vpe.Timer.pause*
      Pause the timer.

      This invokes vim’s timer_pause function.

    resume()                                        *resume* *vpe.Timer.resume*
      Resume the timer, if paused.

      This invokes vim’s timer_pause function.

    stop()                                              *stop* *vpe.Timer.stop*
      Stop the timer.

      This invokes vim’s timer_stop function.

class vpe.Variables(obj=None)                       *Variables* *vpe.Variables*
  Wrapper around the various vim variable dictionaries.

  This allows entries to be modified.

  A wrapper around and replacement for the vim module.

  This is a instance object not a module, but it provides a API that is
  extremely compatible with the |python-vim| module.

    property error -> Type[_vim.error]                          *vpe.Vim.error*
      The plain built-in Vim exception (|python-error|).

    property options -> |GlobalOptions|                       *vpe.Vim.options*
      An object providing access to Vim’s global options.

    property registers -> |Registers|           *registers* *vpe.Vim.registers*

    static __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs)                      *vpe.Vim.__new__*
      Ensure only a single Vim instance ever exists.

      This means that code like:
        >
        myvim = vpe.Vim()
<
      Will result in the same object as |vim|.

                                                     *vpe.Vim.iter_all_windows*
    static iter_all_windows() -> Iterator[tuple[|TabPage|, |Window|]]
      Iterate over all the windows in all tabs.

      Parameters

        yield
          A tuple of TagPage and Window.

      Get the underlying built-in vim module.

class vpe.VimError(error: _vim.error)                 *VimError* *vpe.VimError*
  A parsed version of vim.error.

  VPE code raises this in place of the standard vim.error exception. It is a
  subclass of vim.error, so code that handles vim.error will still work when
  converted to use the |vim| object.

  This exception attempts to parse the Vim error string to provide additional
  attributes:

  Attributes

    code: int:                                              *vpe.VimError.code*
      The error code. This will be zero if parsing failed to extract the code.

    command: str:                                        *vpe.VimError.command*
      The name of the Vim command that raised the error. This may be an empty
      string.

    message: str:                                        *vpe.VimError.message*
      The message part, after extracting the command, error code and ‘Vim’
      prefix. If parsing completely fails then is simply the unparsed message.

class vpe.Window(window)                                  *Window* *vpe.Window*
  Wrapper around a |python-window|.

  User code should not directly instantiate this class. VPE creates and manages
  instances of this class as required.

  This is a proxy that extends the vim.Window behaviour in various ways.

  Attributes

    id                                                          *vpe.Window.id*
      This is the window’s unique ID (as obtained by |win_getid|).

  Properties

    property vars -> |Variables|                              *vpe.Window.vars*
      The buffer vars wrapped as a |Variables| instance.

                                                *vpe.Window.visible_line_range*
    property visible_line_range -> tuple[int, int]
      The range of buffer lines visible within this window.

      This is a Python style range.

  Methods

    close() -> bool                                          *vpe.Window.close*
      Close this window, if possible.

      Return value

      True if the window was closed.

    goto() -> bool                                            *vpe.Window.goto*
      Switch to this window, if possible.

      Return value

      True if the current window was set successfully.

    temp_options(**presets) -> TemporaryOptions       *vpe.Window.temp_options*
      Context used to temporarily change options.

      This does for a window what |temp_options| does for buffer.

  Static methods

                                                  *vpe.Window.win_id_to_window*
    static win_id_to_window(win_id: str) -> |Window| | None
      Return the window corresponding to a given window ID.

class vpe.Windows(obj=None)                             *Windows* *vpe.Windows*
  Wrapper around the built-in vim.windows.

  User code should not directly instantiate this class. VPE creates and manages
  instances of this class as required.

  Parameters

    obj
      A |python-windows| object.

class vpe.saved_current_window                       *vpe.saved_current_window*
  Context manager that saves and restores the active window.

class vpe.saved_winview                                     *vpe.saved_winview*
  Context manager that saves and restores the current window’s view.

class vpe.temp_active_window(win: wrappers.Window)     *vpe.temp_active_window*
  Context manager that temporarily changes the active window.

  Parameters

    win
      The |Window| to switch to.

                                                    *call_soon* *vpe.call_soon*
vpe.call_soon(func: Callable, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any)
  Arrange to call a function ‘soon’.

  This uses a Vim timer with a delay of 0ms to schedule the function call. This
  means that currently executing Python code will complete before the function
  is invoked.

  The function is invoked as:
    >
    func(*args, **kwargs)
<
  Parameters

    func: Callable
      The function to be invoked.

    args: Any
      Positional arguments for the callback function.

    kwargs: Any
      Keyword arguments for the callback function.

                                                           *vpe.call_soon_once*
vpe.call_soon_once(token: Any, func: Callable, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any)
  Arrange to call a function ‘soon’, but only once.

  This is like |call_soon|, but if multiple calls with the same token are
  scheduled then only the first registed function is invoked when Vim’s main
  loop regains control.

  Parameters

    token: Any
      A token that identifies duplicate registered callbacks. This can be any
      object that may be a member of a set, except None.

    func: Callable
      The function to be invoked.

    args: Any
      Positional arguments for the callback function.

    kwargs: Any
      Keyword arguments for the callback function.

<
  Create a user defined command that invokes a Python function.

  When the command is executed, the function is invoked as:
    >
    func(info, *args, *cmd_args, **kwargs)
<
  The info parameter is |CommandInfo| instance which carries all the meta
  information, such as the command name, range, modifiers, etc. The cmd_args
  are those provided to the command; each is a string. The args and kwargs are
  those provided to this function.

  Parameters

    name: str
      The command name; must follow the rules for `:command`.

    func: Callable
      The function that implements the command.

    nargs: int | str
      The number of supported arguments; must follow the rules for `:command-
      nargs`, except that integer values of 0, 1 are permitted.

    complete: str
      Argument completion mode (see |command-complete|). Does not currently
      support ‘custom’ or ‘customlist’.

    range: bool | int | str
      The permitted type of range; must follow the rules for `:command-range`,
      except that the N value may be an integer.

    count: int | str
      The permitted type of count; must follow the rules for `:command-count`,
      except that the N value may be an integer. Use count=0 to get the same
      behaviour as ‘-count’.

    addr: str
      How range or count values are interpreted (see `:command-addr`).

    bang: bool
      If set then the ‘!’ modifieer is supported (see `:command-bang`).

    bar: bool
      If set then the command may be followed by a ‘|’ (see `:command-bar`).

    register: bool
      If set then an optional register is supported (see `:command-register`).

    buffer: bool
      If set then the command is only for the current buffer (see `:command-
      buffer`).

    replace: bool
      If set (the default) then ‘command!’ is used to replace an existing
      command of the same name.

    pass_info: bool
      If set then the first argument passed to func is a MappingInfo object.
      Defaults to True.

    args
      Additional arguments to pass to the mapped function.

    kwargs: dict | None
      Additional keyword arguments to pass to the mapped function.

vpe.dot_vim_dir() -> str                                      *vpe.dot_vim_dir*
  Provide the likely path to the ~/.vim directory or its equivalent.

  All this does is lookup $MYVIMDIR.

vpe.echo_msg(*args, soon=False)                                  *vpe.echo_msg*
  Like |error_msg|, but for information.

  Parameters

    args
      All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings before output.

    soon
      If set, delay invocation until the back in the Vim main loop.

vpe.error_msg(*args, soon=False)                    *error_msg* *vpe.error_msg*
  A print-like function that writes an error message.

  Unlike using sys.stderr directly, this does not raise a vim.error.

  Parameters

    args
      All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings before output.

    soon
      If set, delay invocation until the back in the Vim main loop.

                                                      *vpe.find_buffer_by_name*
vpe.find_buffer_by_name(name: str) -> wrappers.Buffer | None
  Find the buffer with a given name.

            name: str,
            buf_class: Type[ScratchBuffer] = <class 'vpe.core.ScratchBuffer'>
<
  Get a named display-only buffer.

  The actual buffer name will be of the form ‘/[[name]]’. The buffer is created
  if it does not already exist.

  Parameters

    name: str
      An identifying name for this buffer. This becomes the
      |vpe.ScratchBuffer.simple_name| attribute.

                            *get_managed_io_buffer* *vpe.get_managed_io_buffer*
vpe.get_managed_io_buffer(...)
    >
    get_managed_io_buffer(
            buf_class: Type[ManagedIOBuffer],
            name: str = '',
            literal_name: str = ''
<
  Get a named managed I/O buffer.

  The actual buffer name will be of the form ‘/[<name>]’ if name is provided
  and simply the literal_name otherwise. The buffer is created if it does not
  already exist.

  Parameters

    name: str
      An identifying name for this buffer. This take precedence over the
      literal_name.

    literal_name: str
      If this is provided and name has a false value then it is used as the
      literal name for the buffer.

vpe.highlight(...)                                              *vpe.highlight*
    >
    highlight(

            debug: bool = False,
            file: TextIO or None = None,
<
  Execute a highlight command.

  This provides keyword arguments for all the command parameters. These are
  generally taken from the `:highlight` command’s documentation.

  Parameters

    group: str | None
      The name of the group being defined. If omitted then all other arguments
      except clear are ignored.

    clear: bool
      If set then the command highlight clear [<group>] is generated. All other
      arguments are ignored.

    disable: bool
      If set then the specified group is disabled using the command:

        highlight <group> NONE

    link: str | None
      If set then a link command will be generated of the form:

        highlight link <group> <link>.

      Other arguments are ignored.

    default: bool
      If set then the generated command has the form highlight default....

    debug: bool
      Print the command’s arguments, for debugging use.

    kwargs
      The remaining keyword arguments act like the `:highlight` command’s
      keyword arguments.

vpe.pedit(path: str, silent=True, noerrors=False)                   *vpe.pedit*
  Edit file in the preview window.

  Parameters

    path: str
      The files path.

    silent
      If true then run the :pedit command silently.

        If, for example, |name| is ‘omega’ then (on Linux) the file
        ~/.vim/config.d/omega.ini will be loaded. Any existing option values
        not found in the file are left unchanged. Any value in the file that
        does not match a defined option is simply ignored.

      options_() -> Dict[str, vpe.config.Option]       *config.Config.options_*
        Get the dictionary of options.

      save_()                                             *config.Config.save_*
        Save options to an INI file.

        If, for example, |name| is ‘omega’ then (on Linux) the file
        ~/.vim/config.d/omega.ini will be written. All previous contents of the
        file will be lost.

  3.4. Module vpe.core~                 *vpe.module-core* *vpe.module-vpe-core*

  Enhanced module for using Python 3 in Vim.

  This provides the Vim class, which is a wrapper around Vim’s built-in vim
  module. It is intended that a Vim instance can be uses as a replacement for
  the vim module. For example:
    >
    from vpe import vim
    # Now use 'vim' as an extended version of the ``vim`` module.
    # ...
<

  class core.expr_arg(arg: str)                                 *core.expr_arg*
    Wrapper for a Vim argument that is an expression.

    This is used to wrap a string that represents an expression that should be
    passed to a Vim function, without being quoted.

    Parameters

      arg
        The argument as a string representing the Vim expression.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------~
  3.5. Module vpe.diffs~              *vpe.module-diffs* *vpe.module-vpe-diffs*

  Types involved in tracking changes.

                                                          *AddOp* *diffs.AddOp*
  class diffs.AddOp(lnum: int, end: int, added: int, col: int)
    A buffer addition operation.

                                                    *ChangeOp* *diffs.ChangeOp*
  class diffs.ChangeOp(lnum: int, end: int, added: int, col: int)
    A buffer change operation.

                                                    *DeleteOp* *diffs.DeleteOp*
  class diffs.DeleteOp(lnum: int, end: int, added: int, col: int)
    A buffer deletion operation.

                                                  *Operation* *diffs.Operation*
  class diffs.Operation(lnum: int, end: int, added: int, col: int)
    Base for each type of a line buffer modification.

    This stores information about changes to a sub-sequence of lines. This
    stores information about what has changed, not the details of the change.
    For example, it will identify that N lines have been added after a given
    line, but not the contents of those new lines.

    This is not directly instantiated by VPE code, one of the subclasses
    |AddOp|, |DeleteOp| or |ChangeOp| is always used. And these should be
    created using the |from_vim_change| class method.

    Parameters

      lnum
        The lnum value from a Vim change list entry.

      end
        The end value from a Vim change list entry.

      added
        The added value from a Vim change list entry.

      col
        The col value from a Vim change list entry.

    Attributes

      a                                                     *diffs.Operation.a*
        The start of the affected line range == lnum - 1.

      b                                                     *diffs.Operation.b*
        The end of the affected line range  == end - 1.

      col                                                 *diffs.Operation.col*
        The first affected column == col - 1. This is a value the Vim supplies
        buffer listener callbacks. It is stored here but not used by any
        methods.

      delta                                             *diffs.Operation.delta*
        The change in line count, set from added.

      name: ClassVar:                                    *diffs.Operation.name*
        The start of the affected line range == lnum - 1.

    Properties

      property count -> int                             *diffs.Operation.count*
        The number of lines affected.

        This is always zero or more, zero indicating a change operation.

    Methods

      __getitem__(key)                            *diffs.Operation.__getitem__*
        Emulation of Vim’s buffer modification operation dictionary.

        This is provided to avoid breaking the VPE 0.6 API too much, but using
        this is deprecated.

      apply_to(buf: MutableSequence[str])            *diffs.Operation.apply_to*
        Simplistically apply this change to a line buffer.

          NOTE: This method may be removed because its usefulness is very
            questionable.

        This adds blank lines, delete lines or replaces lines with empty
        strings, depending on the specific Operation subclass.

        This is necessarily a simplistic operation because the |Operation|
        class does not store contents of added or changed lines.

      items() -> Iterator[tuple[str, int]]              *diffs.Operation.items*
        Emulation of Vim’s buffer modification operation dictionary.

        This is provided to avoid breaking the VPE 0.6 API too much, but using
        this is deprecated.

            changed.

          col: int
            The starting column for a change.

  3.6. Module vpe.mapping~        *vpe.module-mapping* *vpe.module-vpe-mapping*

  Python support for key sequence mapping.

  This module provides support for mapping key sequences to Python function
  calls.

  class mapping.KeyHandler                                 *mapping.KeyHandler*
    Mix-in to support mapping key sequences to methods.

    Methods

                                             *mapping.KeyHandler.auto_map_keys*
      auto_map_keys(pass_info: bool = False)
        Set up mappings for methods.

    Static methods

      static mapped(...)                            *mapping.KeyHandler.mapped*
          >
          mapped(
                  mode: Union[str, Iterable[str]],
                  keyseq: Union[str, Iterable[str]],
                  **kwargs
<
        Decorator to make a keyboard mapping invoke a method.

        This decorator supports the ‘<Leader>’ prefix in key sequences, in much
        the same way as describled in |mapleader|. For example if g:mapleader
        is set to ‘,’ then the key sequence ‘<Leader>q’ is equivalent to ‘,q’.
        If g:mapleader is unset or blank then ‘' is used.

        The interpretation of <Leader> occurs at the time of decoration, so
        changing g:mapleader after plugin loading will typicallhave no effect.

        Parameters

          mode: Union
            The mode in which the mapping applies, one of normal, op-pending,
            visual or insert. Or an iterable sequence of modes.

          keyseq: Union
            A key sequence string or sequence thereof, as used by |map|.

          kwargs
            See |map| for the supported values.

  class mapping.MapCallback(*args, **kwargs)              *mapping.MapCallback*
    Wrapper for a function to be invoked by a key mapping.

    This extends the core |Callback| to provide a |MappingInfo| as the first
    positional argument.

    Parameters

      pass_info
        If True, provide a MappingInfo object as the first argument to the
        callback function.

    Methods

                                            *mapping.MapCallback.get_call_args*
      get_call_args(_vpe_args: dict[str, Any])
        Get the Python positional and keyword arguments.

        This makes the first positional argument a |MappingInfo| instance,
        unless self.pass_info has been cleared.

                                            *MappingInfo* *mapping.MappingInfo*
  class mapping.MappingInfo(mode: str, keys: str)

      property effective_line_range -> tuple[int, int] | None
        The effective line range.

        If the mod is ‘visual’ then this is the same as |line_range| otherwise
        it is lidx, lidx + 1.

                                  *line_range* *mapping.MappingInfo.line_range*
      property line_range -> tuple[int, int] | None
        The line range, if visual mode was active.

        This is a Python style range.

      >
      map(
              mode: str,

              vim_exprs: tuple[str, ...] = ()
<
    Set up a key mapping that invokes a Python function.

    By default, the effective map command has the form:

      {m}noremap <buffer> <silent> keys …

    Where {m} is one of n, x, o, i.

    The noremap form is always used.

    By default the first argument passed to the mapped function is a
    |MappingInfo| object. The pass_info argument can be used to prevent this.
    Additional arguments can be specified using args and kwargs.

    For convenience, mode specific versions are provided (|nmap|, |xmap|,
    |omap| and |imap|). See those for details of what he mapped function can
    do. It is recommended that these mode specific versions are use in
    preference to this function.

    The func argument may also be a string, in which case it is interpreted as
    the literal RHS of the key mapping.

    Parameters

      mode: str
        A string defining the mode in which the mapping occurs. This should be
        one of: normal, visual, op-pending, insert, command, select. The
        command and select mode are not supported when func is not a string.

      keys: Union
        The key sequence to be mapped. This may be an iterable set of key
        sequences that should all be mapped to the same action.

      func: Union
        The Python function to invoke for the mapping or a string to use as the
        right hand side of the mapping.

      buffer: bool
        Use the <buffer> special argument. Defaults to True.

      silent: bool
        Use the <silent> special argument. Defaults to True.

      unique: bool
        Use the <unique> special argument. Defaults to False.

      nowait: bool
        Use the <nowait> special argument. Defaults to False.

      command: bool
        Only applicable to insert mode. If true then the function is invoked
        from the command prompt and the return value is not used. Otherwise
        (the default) the function should return the text to be inserted.

      pass_info
        If set then the first argument passed to func is a MappingInfo object.
        Defaults to True.

      args
        Additional arguments to pass to the mapped function.

      kwargs: Optional
        Additional keyword arguments to pass to the mapped function.

      vim_exprs: tuple
        Vim expressions to be evaluated and passed to the callback function,
        when the mapping is triggered.

                          *vpe.module-message_bus* *vpe.module-vpe-message-bus*
  3.7. Module vpe.message_bus~

  A pub/sub style message bus.

  This provides a mechanism for routing messages between Python objects within
  a Vim session.

  Client code retrieves a message bus using a suitable name, such as the name
  of the plugin:
    >
    bus = message_bus.named_message_bus('my-plugin-name')
<
  The |message_bus.Bus.post|, |post_simple_message| and
  |message_bus.Bus.subscribe| methods are used to send and receive messages.
  Subscribers receive messages vai callbacks that invoked by |call_soon|.

  Each messages is identified by a name, which is a simple string. Client code
  subscribes to message using message names. All naming convention choices are
  up to the client code, the message bus code simply uses message names as keys
  that map to subscribers.

  For most applications all messages can simply be instances of the
  |SimpleMessage| class created and posted using |post_simple_message|.

  class message_bus.Bus(name: str)                      *Bus* *message_bus.Bus*
    A message bus.

    This implements a form of pub/sub pattern.

    Methods

      post(message: |SimpleMessage|) -> None             *message_bus.Bus.post*
        Post a message onto the bus.

                    *post_simple_message* *message_bus.Bus.post_simple_message*
      post_simple_message(name: str, *args: Any) -> None
        Create and post a |SimpleMessage|.

        This is basically a convience method for:
          >
          message = SimpleMessage(name, args)
          bus.post(message)
<

      subscribe(...)                                *message_bus.Bus.subscribe*
          >
          subscribe(
                  name: str,
                  callback: MessageCallback,
                  predicate: MessageMatcher | None = None
<
        Subscribe to a named message.

        Parameters

          name: str
            The name of the message being subscribed to.

          callback: Callable
            The function to be invoked when a matching message is received. The
            function is invoked with the matching message and the |Bus|
            instance.

          predicate: Optional
            A function that is invoked to (further) filter which messages are
            passed to the callback.

                                    *SimpleMessage* *message_bus.SimpleMessage*
  class message_bus.SimpleMessage(name: str, args: Any)
    A simple message that carries arbitrary data.

    It is typically easier to use |post_simple_message| rather than directly
    contructing instances of this class.

    Parameters

      name
        A name for the message.

      args
        An arbitrary object carrying the message’s argument. It is common to
        make this a tuple, which is what |post_simple_message| does.

    Attributes

      args                                     *message_bus.SimpleMessage.args*
        An arbitrary object carrying the message’s argument. It is common to
        make this a tuple, which is what |post_simple_message| does.

      name                                     *message_bus.SimpleMessage.name*
        A name for the message.

  message_bus.handle_message(name: str)            *message_bus.handle_message*
    Mark a method as a message handler.

    Parameters

      name: str
        The name of the message to be handled.

                                         *message_bus.install_message_handlers*
  message_bus.install_message_handlers(obj: object, bus_name: str) -> None
    Install a handler for a given class instance.

                                                *message_bus.named_message_bus*
  message_bus.named_message_bus(name: str) -> |Bus|
    Create or retrieve the message bus with a given name.

    The first time this is invoked with a given name a new |Bus| instance is
    created. Subsequent calls with the same name retrieve the same |Bus|
    instance.

    Parameters

      name: str
        The name of the bus.

  3.8. Module vpe.panels~           *vpe.module-panels* *vpe.module-vpe-panels*

  Simple display and control panel framework.

  This is still being developed. The API and behaviour is likely to change.

  The basic idea is that the contents of a buffer is divided into a sequence of
  panels.:
    >
    .-------------------------------------------------------------------.
    |Panel 1 contents.                                                  |
    |-------------------------------------------------------------------|
    |Panel 2 contents.                                                  |
    |                                                                   |
    |-------------------------------------------------------------------|
    |Panel 3 contents.                                                  |
    |                                                                   |
    :                                                                   :
<
  The contents of each panel is managed by a |Panel| subclass. The panels are
  managed by a |PanelViewBuffer|.

  class panels.Panel                                     *Panel* *panels.Panel*
    Part of a |PanelViewBuffer|.

    Parameters

      view: PanelViewBuffer
        The parent |PanelViewBuffer|. This is set by |PanelViewBuffer| when a
        panel is added.

      uid: int
        A unique (within the PanelViewBuffer) for this panel.  This is set by
        |PanelViewBuffer| when a panel is added.

    Attributes

      content                                  *content* *panels.Panel.content*
        The formatted content of this panel as a sequence of line. This should
        only be set by the |format_contents| method.

      old_slice                                        *panels.Panel.old_slice*
        The buffer slice for previous content. This is set to None by the
        apply_updates method.

        TODO: The reindex method must update this when it is not None.

      start_lidx                         *start_lidx* *panels.Panel.start_lidx*
        The index of this panel’s first line within the buffer.

    Properties

      property buf_slice                               *panels.Panel.buf_slice*
        A slice object to select this panel’s line range.

      property end_lidx                                 *panels.Panel.end_lidx*
        The end index of the panel;s line range.

      property syntax_prefix                       *panels.Panel.syntax_prefix*
        A suitable prefix for syntax items in this panel.

    Methods

      apply_syntax()                                *panels.Panel.apply_syntax*
        Apply syntax highlighting for this panel.

        This may be over-ridden in subclasses that need specialised syntax
        highlighting.

        This is only called when the panel’s |start_lidx| is correctly set.
        Previous panel specific syntax must be deleted by this method.

      apply_updates() -> bool                      *panels.Panel.apply_updates*
        Apply any changes since the last call to this method.

        This is where modifications to the underlying Vim buffer contents are
        performed.

        Return value

        True if the buffer was updated.

      format_contents()        *format_contents* *panels.Panel.format_contents*
        Format this panel’s contents.

        If the number of content lines changes then the parent view’s
        |notify_size_change| method is invoked. If this results in the
        formatted contents changing then the parent view’s
        |notify_content_change| method is invoked.

        This invokes the |on_format_contents| method, which is responsible for
        filling the |content| list.

                         *on_format_contents* *panels.Panel.on_format_contents*
      on_format_contents() -> None
        Format the content of this panel.

        The content is stored as a sequence of lines in the |content| property.
        This needs to be over-ridden in concrete subclasses.

      reindex(idx: int) -> int                           *panels.Panel.reindex*
        Update the line index information for this panel.

        This is invoked when a panel is first added to a |PanelViewBuffer| and
        when the |PanelViewBuffer| determines that the panel’s starting line
        may have changed.

        Parameters

          idx: int
            The start line index for this panel.

        Return value

        The start line index for any following panel.

      set_view(view: |PanelViewBuffer|, uid: int)       *panels.Panel.set_view*
        Set the parent |PanelViewBuffer|.

        Parameters

          view: PanelViewBuffer
            The parent |PanelViewBuffer|.

          uid: int
            The PanelViewBuffer unique ID for this panel.

                                     *PanelViewBuffer* *panels.PanelViewBuffer*
  class panels.PanelViewBuffer(*args, **kwargs)
    A |ScratchBuffer| organised as vertical sequence of panels.

    This provides support for the content of panels to be independently
    updated. The PanelView is responsible for making the buffer correctly
    reflect the content of the constituent panels.

    Each panel is responsible for notifying its parent PanelViewBuffer when
    significant changes have occurred, such as lines being added, removed or
    modified.

    Properties

      property data                               *panels.PanelViewBuffer.data*
        The data store for this panel view.

      property panels                           *panels.PanelViewBuffer.panels*
        The sequence of panels for this display buffer.

    Methods

      add_panel(panel: |Panel|)              *panels.PanelViewBuffer.add_panel*
        Add a panel at the end of the panel list.

      format_panel(panel: |Panel|)        *panels.PanelViewBuffer.format_panel*
        Make a panel refresh itself.

                                          *panels.PanelViewBuffer.insert_panel*
      insert_panel(panel: |Panel|, index: int)
        Insert a panel into the panel list.

        The new panel’s content must be empty.

        Parameters

          panel: Panel
            The panel to insert.

          index: int
            Where to insert the panel.

        Perform special processing when line reindexing has occurred.

        Subclasses may over-ride this.

      on_set_syntax()                    *panels.PanelViewBuffer.on_set_syntax*
        Perform special processing when syntax is defined.

        Subclasses may over-ride this.

      std
        If true then the group is treated as not in the Syntax object’s
        namespace.

      contained
        If true then all matches, keywords and regions this creates
        automatically have the contained option set.

                                                     *syntax.Group.region_type*

  3.11. Module vpe.user_commands~

  Support user commands based on Python’s argparse module.

  This module makes it easy to implement complex user commands. The features
  provided are:

    - Support for optional arguments.

    - Clean implementation of subcommands.

    - Subcommands, and options can be abbreviated.

    - Automatic command line completion.

      - The parse_args and parse_known_args methods do not try to invoke
        sys.exit().

      - It has support for partial command completions that work the way I
        expect.

      - The word ‘prog’ is generally replaced by ‘command_name’, just to be
        consistent with |CommandHandler| and its subclasses.

      - Parser defaults are not supported (those set by set_defaults). Defaults
        have to be specified as part of add_argument.

    Methods

                                    *user_commands.ArgumentParser.add_argument*
      add_argument(*args, **kwargs)
        Define how a single command-line argument should be parsed.

        This wraps the standard method in order to support command completion.

                             *user_commands.ArgumentParser.do_parse_known_args*
      do_parse_known_args(args: Sequence[str]) -> tuple[Namespace, list[str]]
        Parse known arguments, stopping at a subcommand.

        This is a modified version from the Python 3.11 standard library. This
        version stops processing arguments when a subcommand is encountered.
        The upshot is that optional arguments are get properly associated with
        the correct main command or subcommand.

      error(message)                       *user_commands.ArgumentParser.error*
        Raise an ArgumentError.

      exit(status=0, message=None)          *user_commands.ArgumentParser.exit*
        Raise ArgumentError.

                                 *user_commands.ArgumentParser.get_completions*
      get_completions(arglead: str) -> list[str]
        Get the possible completions for a partial command.

        Parameters

          arglead: str
            The partial argument to be completed.

        Return value

        A list of possible completion strings.

                                      *user_commands.ArgumentParser.parse_args*
      parse_args(args: Sequence[str])
        Convert argument strings to attributes of the namespace.

                  no_help: bool = False
<
        Parse known arguments from the command line.

        This version does not try to sys.exit().

        As of Python 3.9.3, the exit_on_error initialisation argument does not
        work in the way expect.

  3.12. Module vpe.windows~       *vpe.module-windows* *vpe.module-vpe-windows*

  Window specific support.

  This provides support for working with Vim window layouts. The intended way
  to use this is to use |windows.LayoutElement.create_from_vim_layout|. For
  example:
    >
    layout = LayoutElement.create_from_vim_layout(vim.winlayout())
<
  The returned value will be a |LayoutRow|, |LayoutColumn| or |LayoutWindow|
  window instance. Use the |type_name| class attribute when it is necessary to
  know the actual type.

                                          *LayoutColumn* *windows.LayoutColumn*
  class windows.LayoutColumn(elements: List)

                                *vpe.module-wrappers* *vpe.module-vpe-wrappers*
  3.13. Module vpe.wrappers~

  Wrappers around the built-in Vim Python types.

  You should not normally need to import this module directly.

                                                 *Commands* *wrappers.Commands*
  class wrappers.Commands(modifiers: dict[str, bool] = None)
    A namespace for the set of Vim commands.

    A single instance of this class is made available as |vpe.commands|.

    This class provides functions for a majority of Vim’s commands, often
    providing a cleaner mechanism compared to |python-command|. For example:
      >
      from vpe import commands
      commands.edit('README.txt')       # Start editing README.txt
      commands.print(a=10, b=20)        # Print lines 1 to 20
      commands.print(lrange=(10, 20))   # Print lines 1 to 20
      commands.write(bang=True)         # Same as :w!
      commands.split(vertical=True)     # Split current window vertically
<
    Each command function is actually an instance of the Command class. See its
    description for details of the arguments.

    Most commands that can be entered at the colon prompt are supported.
    Structural parts of vim-script (such as function, while, try, etc) are
    excluded.

    The vpe, vpe.mapping and vpe.syntax modules provides some functions and
    classes as alternatives for some commands. You are encouraged to use these
    alternatives in preference to the equivalent functions provided here. The
    following is a summary of the alternatives.

      |AutoCmdGroup|
        A replacement for augroup and autocmd.

      |vpe.highlight|
        Provides keyword style arguments. See also the |syntax| module.

      |error_msg|
        Writes a message with error highlighting, but does not raise a
        vim.error.

      |mapping|
        This provides functions to make key mappings that are handled by Python
        functions.

      |syntax|
        Provides a set of classes, functions and context managers to help
        define syntax highlighting.

    See also: |vpe.pedit|.

    Parameters

      modifiers
        A dictionary of the default modifier flags for generated Command
        instances. This is only intended to be used by the |with_modifiers|
        class method.

    Class methods

                            *with_modifiers* *wrappers.Commands.with_modifiers*
      classmethod with_modifiers(**modifiers)
        Return a version of Commands that always applies modifiers.

        For example:
          >
          silent = vpe.commands.modified(silent=True)
          silent.tabonly()
<
        Is equivalent to:
          >
          vpe.commands.tabonly(silent=True)
<
